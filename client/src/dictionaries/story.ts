  "In a small town there was an old man named Ben. He fixed clocks in a little shop by the market. His shop was full of ticking sounds like music in the air. Ben had a pocket watch that was always fifteen minutes ahead. People in town often wondered why but no one asked. One day a boy named Tom came in with a broken toy car. While ben fixed it Tom said your watch is wrong. Ben smiled. It is not wrong he said. It helps me stay ahead so I never waste a moment. Tom nodded and left holding his fixed car. From that day he tried to use his time a little better just like Ben.";
